What I loved the most is that every time I wanted or needed something - Todd had already provided it.   (This has not been my experience at some Airbnb's before).  Ya Todd!   The neighborhood is safe, within walking distance to Harvard Square and Harvard Business School and also easy access to public transportation if you need it.   However, I highly recommend Uber - it's cheaper and faster and more entertaining.   <br>If you want a superb place to rest your head, then Todd is your Host.

The neighborhood is very safe, and it's a beautiful walk along the river to Harvard Square.  We especially loved the new kitchen with everything we needed, and the large living room with a flat screen TV.  There's also free laundry in the basement (new machines) and a nice little deck on the side that's perfect for eating dinner on.  We give this house and host 5 stars for everything.</td>\n",

First of all, they allowed us to drop off our bags early since we arrived at 6am. First impression of the host, very warm and gracious . The room was  Super clean , neat and nicely decorated, looks better than the pictures. Oh, we slept like babies. Mike offered breakfast, fruits , snacks, etc. They even had ice cream. Being in a new area can be intimidating, but Mike was always there to give advice on the train, directions and points of interest. Susie,  I only talked to on the phone , nevertheless, she made herself available , made sure we made our way home safe from the city or that our needs were all attended to. And they allowed us to leave our bags on checkout day , since we were not leaving till late PM. Did I mention that they the first train stop from the airport and about 5 min walk? We were very impressed and so happy . I wish all Airbnb have the same standard. We just felt like home. Mike and Susie , thank you very much for the wonderful accommodation. You made our trip much more memorable. Highly recommend. 110 percent. </td>\n",

The room closet is VERY big and totally empty for our use. The bed was, I believe, brand new with a firm and very comfortable mattress. Trundle bed was perfect for our kids and easy to use. Plenty of lighting. Decor was thoughtful, classy and (again) immaculate! Being right next to the airport, it came as no surprise that we heard a couple airplanes overhead.  (Kids slept right through them.)<br><br>Bathroom was immaculately clean with fresh towels and a new sink/vanity.<br><br>We didn't use the galley kitchen much but it appeared to be newly renovated with attractive tile and a modern design.<br><br>We very much enjoyed our dinner in the neighborhood which was at a Peruvian restaurant, Rincon Limeno.

The apartment had the best beds and had so much space to spread out - plus it was really quiet.  In addition to Jason’s fantastic hospitality and great decorating skills, we had the pleasure of meeting Jason’s father – Larry - and finally taking them up on their harbor cruise / sail aboard their yacht – Kayla.  This was the most incredible way to see Boston Harbor and Larry’s sailboat was absolutely gorgeous.  Finding out the yacht had been used in The Town – a famous movie filmed in Boston – made the experience that much cooler.  Thank you Jason and Larry for another great stay and a wonderful sail.  We can’t wait to come back and stay with Jason.</td>\n",

From his taste in decor, to the cleanliness of his space, it all was better than we could have hoped for!  He is incredibly kind, friendly and accommodating.  All of our needs were met, even down to having Nespresso in the morning, is there a 6th star for service??   The location of the apartment was great.  It's a clean, safe and scenic part of town.  Extra points for there being a whole foods 20 feet away!  It was truly a pleasure staying here and I know for certain that we will book with Aurelien again!</td>\n",

Within 15 minutes you can reach Northeastern's Campus, Back Bay/South End, or Downtown Crossing. I bought a T pass and just hopped on and hopped off it all the time. He also lives just two blocks off the main street (Centre St.)  in Jamaica Plain. There you can easily pick up drinks, or have fantastic local eats! I had ice cream from J.P. Licks (Brownie Batter and Coffee Cookies n' Cream :P) and amazing Lebanese food from Cafe Beirut. There are tons of other places to eat including Thai, American, and Latin restaurants.

This makes being near a T stop is so important as the mass transit in Boston moves you quickly and easily around the metro area.  The unit is located a quick and easy 4 minute walk through the very pleasant and secure neighborhood to the Green Street T stop which gets you into the heart of Boston in 6-8 minutes.

I was there for such a short amount of time that I didn't need it but it would've been nice to know. The stairs up to the lofted bed are somewhat steep so be careful!

Since it is a penthouse, you have to walk up a couple flights, but no issues for us.  This penthouse is in a great location for taking in many sites around Boston. We enjoyed our walks from Beacon Hill down past Faneuil Hall to the waterfront where we embarked on a whale watch.

Todd was especially attentive to details for travelers like myself who are use to high level of service.  The house was impeccable and furnished with taste and style which made for a relaxing, restful stay.   I couldn't be more pleased with how beautiful this house is.    The neighborhood was quite, safe and an easy walk to Harvard Square - which is a must for food, fun and people watching.   Having other guests in the house created a warm feeling of international community and interesting conversations.  The sincere caring that Todd shows for his guests leaves you with a feeling of being welcomed and wanting to come back.   I would highly recommend Todd as a host as he provided such a comfortable and amazing experience for myself and the other guests.  </td>\n",

Everything in the house was so well thought out, he even had mini toiletries (we needed a toothbrush and toothpaste) available for us when we asked.   Harvard Business School is about a 5 minute walk away, and   there's terrific restaurants within a 10 - 15 minute walk with any kind of cuisine you could imagine.  We will definitely be coming back to Todd's house next time we visit Boston.</td>\n",

The famous acorn St is a few blocks away.<br>Close to everything ( hubway around the block for bike rental for short rides in the city) 15 mins walk to the North end ( where it has the best restaurants in Boston), Quincy market, Haymarket and Boston public market. 20 mins walk to the esplanade and museum of science. 10 mins walk to red line T station and MGH. <br>Alex was very responsive and he provided adequate instruction to ensure a smooth check in. The place is very clean. Blow dryer was also provided for ladies and I think that's very considerate of Alex. I travelled with my husband and we had a great night of sleep on the memory form mattress but might be a bit snuggly for couples of bigger body frames. Another tenant was in the apt during our stay but he was quite and the curtain provided sufficient privacy.  Parking can be difficult around the area but Alex gave great advice. We ended up parking at the 1 center plaza for $24 for the weekends ($12/ day from 4p-4a). Overall, can't beat the price for what it offers.   I will recommend it. </td>\n",

The air conditioner worked great, even in the August heat and at the end of a long day, the murphy bed was like sleeping in a cloud and didn't mind at all that it was a pull out. Her 1 bedroom/1 bath was clean, modernly decorated, stocked with everything you'd need and more.<br><br>She also took the time to provide a great packet of info about the place, our stay, local spots/recommendations (which we loved AND used). We had a smooth arrival process, stay and easy check out. Really, she always was a quick text away. Bonus, she and her family live in the upstairs flat so anything we needed was quickly provided.<br>     <br>My husband and I loved walking and exploring the South End and adjacent neighborhoods. We walked all over, day and night. It was close to the Freedom trail, Newbury Street, Boston Common and Fenway, and we considered it safe, convenient, and super desirable. We also used Lyft and caught the T. Overall, transportation was super easy and there were many options.<br>     <br>Mary's place was INCREDIBLE and she was such a blessing. We are extremely grateful.

We will definitely be back, and hopefully will be able to stay here again!</td>\n",

The extra touches made us feel so comfortable. Speaking of comfortable ... that bed was so so so so wonderful. Jealous I don't have a bed that nice at home. With that being said there was one drawback and that is, you are in a garden apartment (bottom floor), and I could hear walking back and forth all morning that made it hard to sleep in. At one point I thought that they were bowling upstairs but then after meeting their dog I realize he was most likely the culprit. I would definitely stay again, but being a light sleeper bring ear plugs. Totally worth it for the space. </td>\n",

Our only problem was we wish we could have stayed a week! It was equipped with anything you would need or want to stay that long.<br>Ease of check in and out was fantastic. We also got around quite easily walking to everywhere we went including, Fenway and the Waterfront and North end but using Uber a few times was inexpensive and a breeze from this location which has a great little wine shop on the corner and lots of restaurants and conveniences very close by.<br><br>We can't wait to come back!<br></td>\n",

Both were incredibly warm, friendly and helpful, graciously accommodating their check in times with our flight schedule and giving us a ton of recommendations to make our trip worthwhile. They have so much knowledge and love for this city and it has been one of my favourite travel experiences so far. <br><br>The location can't be beat – my partner and I never had to take any mode of transportation (except for a very short train ride to Cambridge, and even then we enjoyed a beautiful walk back). There were so many great restaurants, cafes, and shopping areas nearby and it was a great way to get a feel for the city. The unit gave us plenty of privacy while still being close enough to the hosts to call for help. The only thing I would've changed is that I wouldn't have packed so many things because the apartment had everything I could need! So much better than a hotel, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Boston. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay! </td>\n",

There's good food in the area, especially in Chinatown which is only a block or two away and there are metro stations very near by. The bedroom had a fairly comfortable bed and there is a fridge and freezer if you want to save any leftovers. There's also a CVS, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, and walgreens all with in walking distance. There are a number of people who loiter and a few homeless people who seem to sleep on the street the apartment is located on, so just be prepared for it if you aren't used to being central in a big city.

Qing's manager was very kind and friendly and greeted us when we arrived and gave us a quick tour of the apartment. The apartment was very clean and felt comfortable from the moment we arrived.

Within 15 minutes you can reach Northeastern's Campus, Back Bay/South End, or Downtown Crossing. I bought a T pass and just hopped on and hopped off it all the time. He also lives just two blocks off the main street (Centre St.)  in Jamaica Plain. There you can easily pick up drinks, or have fantastic local eats! I had ice cream from J.P. Licks (Brownie Batter and Coffee Cookies n' Cream :P) and amazing Lebanese food from Cafe Beirut. There are tons of other places to eat including Thai, American, and Latin restaurants.

The room was  Super clean , neat and nicely decorated, looks better than the pictures. Oh, we slept like babies. Mike offered breakfast, fruits , snacks, etc. They even had ice cream. Being in a new area can be intimidating, but Mike was always there to give advice on the train, directions and points of interest. Susie,  I only talked to on the phone , nevertheless, she made herself available , made sure we made our way home safe from the city or that our needs were all attended to. And they allowed us to leave our bags on checkout day , since we were not leaving till late PM. Did I mention that they the first train stop from the airport and about 5 min walk? We were very impressed and so happy . I wish all Airbnb have the same standard. We just felt like home. Mike and Susie , thank you very much for the wonderful accommodation. You made our trip much more memorable. Highly recommend. 110 percent. </td>\n",

I had pre-arranged to drop off my luggage very early Sunday morning after a red-eye flight but still felt bad ringing the door bell at 7:00am.  Sarah answered the door with a huge smile, led me upstairs, offered to let me take a shower before I headed out to have breakfast and explore and gave me a nice chilled bottle of water with keys to the main door.  <br><br>She communicated with me on when the room was ready and was there to greet me again and give me the room key.  She had already turned on the room A/C as it was very warm that day and the rest of the apartment didn't seem to be air conditioned.    Every time I saw her she was cheerful, warm and welcoming but really wasn't around much.  <br><br>The  location is just a couple blocks from the T in Eastie, one stop from the airport and 2 stops to State St.  There is road construction going on along the block that starts very early but certainly isn't Hector or Sarah's fault.  I didn't walk the area at night, choosing instead to use uber back from Fenway Park but it is a very quiet emerging neighborhood.  This is the perfect spot for a quick trip if you want to be close to the airport.  I was even able to leave my bag at the apartment until it was time to leave for my flight home thanks to Sarah's generosity.<br><br>Communication from the beginning was super fast and answered all my questions.

The place is very clean. Blow dryer was also provided for ladies and I think that's very considerate of Alex. I travelled with my husband and we had a great night of sleep on the memory form mattress but might be a bit snuggly for couples of bigger body frames. Another tenant was in the apt during our stay but he was quite and the curtain provided sufficient privacy.  Parking can be difficult around the area but Alex gave great advice.

       "        <td>Daniel's review below accurately describes the apartment, surroundings, and convenience. This was a very nice place to stay. Qing and her manager are what earned the 5 star rating. Before we arrived I asked if there was a coffee machine. Qing responded that there was not but she immediately offered to buy one. Not just buy one but asked if there was a model or style that I would prefer...and sure enough it was there when we arrived!! Qing's manager was very kind and friendly and greeted us when we arrived and gave us a quick tour of the apartment. The apartment was very clean and felt comfortable from the moment we arrived. We felt safe with my children there and it the convenient location and subways made it easy to get anywhere in Boston or Cambridge. Overall very nice and I thank Qing and her manager for making it a great stay! I suggest this location as a great value in Boston for a safe convenient place to stay.</td>\n",

       "        <td>The location was perfect for Boston Commons, getting to the Northend or Chinatown either by walking or public transit. The apartment is very close to Boston Commons, just about 50 feet away. The inside of the apartment is very clean. AC in the bedroom is very powerful, careful how you set it or may find yourself quite chilly but it's nice to have good AC in the Boston summer! There's good food in the area, especially in Chinatown which is only a block or two away and there are metro stations very near by. The bedroom had a fairly comfortable bed and there is a fridge and freezer if you want to save any leftovers. There's also a CVS, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, and walgreens all with in walking distance. There are a number of people who loiter and a few homeless people who seem to sleep on the street the apartment is located on, so just be prepared for it if you aren't used to being central in a big city. That said, we had no problems with anyone when staying here. All in all, good experience, would stay here again.</td>\n",

Within 15 minutes you can reach Northeastern's Campus, Back Bay/South End, or Downtown Crossing. I bought a T pass and just hopped on and hopped off it all the time. He also lives just two blocks off the main street (Centre St.)  in Jamaica Plain. There you can easily pick up drinks, or have fantastic local eats! I had ice cream from J.P. Licks (Brownie Batter and Coffee Cookies n' Cream :P) and amazing Lebanese food from Cafe Beirut. There are tons of other places to eat including Thai, American, and Latin restaurants.

The shared bathroom and kitchen were well stocked and free for use, and when your host provides a jet lagged traveller with homemade dinner and fresh fruits and berries for breakfast, it is a place that is hard to beat.  \"),\n",

       "  u\"This was without a doubt the best airbnb experience I've ever had! Mary and Mark were absolutely amazing hosts who went above and beyond to make sure that we experienced the best that Boston had to offer. Both were incredibly warm, friendly and helpful, graciously accommodating their check in times with our flight schedule and giving us a ton of recommendations to make our trip worthwhile. They have so much knowledge and love for this city and it has been one of my favourite travel experiences so far. \\n\\nThe location can't be beat \\u2013 my partner and I never had to take any mode of transportation (except for a very short train ride to Cambridge, and even then we enjoyed a beautiful walk back). There were so many great restaurants, cafes, and shopping areas nearby and it was a great way to get a feel for the city. The unit gave us plenty of privacy while still being close enough to the hosts to call for help. The only thing I would've changed is that I wouldn't have packed so many things because the apartment had everything I could need! So much better than a hotel, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Boston. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay! \"),\n",

She was totally flexible with our schedule, including our train delays on arrival, and made us feel so comfortable and welcome when we arrived. She went above and beyond our expectations. The unit itself is a great space. We were only there for two nights, and didn't spend much time in the apartment, but felt right at home when we were there. Mary had great restaurant and activity suggestions, and truly wanted to show us the best Boston has to offer. She wanted us to love her home city as much as she clearly does. Boston is an incredible, vibrant, historically and culturally rich city and we only wished we could have stayed longer. We will definitely be back, and hopefully will be able to stay here again!\"),\n",

He keeps the apartment clean and cozy. The location couldn't be better. I was in town for a conference at the Sheraton which was a 4 minute walk. There's also a 7-11 on the corner which was convenient. Highly recommend this airbnb!!  \"),\n",

       "  u\"\\nWe couldn't have asked for a better host than Mike /Susie.. Our first time in Boston. We were a party of 3. Only took about an hour to approve our request. First of all, they allowed us to drop off our bags early since we arrived at 6am. First impression of the host, very warm and gracious . The room was  Super clean , neat and nicely decorated, looks better than the pictures. Oh, we slept like babies. Mike offered breakfast, fruits , snacks, etc. They even had ice cream. Being in a new area can be intimidating, but Mike was always there to give advice on the train, directions and points of interest. Susie,  I only talked to on the phone , nevertheless, she made herself available , made sure we made our way home safe from the city or that our needs were all attended to. And they allowed us to leave our bags on checkout day , since we were not leaving till late PM. Did I mention that they the first train stop from the airport and about 5 min walk? We were very impressed and so happy . I wish all Airbnb have the same standard. We just felt like home. Mike and Susie , thank you very much for the wonderful accommodation. You made our trip much more memorable. Highly recommend. 110 percent. \"),\n",

They even had Popsicles and ice cream for our kids!\\n\\nTheir apartment is a second floor walk up, easy to find, and immaculate. We came on a hot weekend and they had our room cooled down nicely with a window unit which was very thoughtful especially since most Bostonians do not need/have AC. The room closet is VERY big and totally empty for our use. The bed was, I believe, brand new with a firm and very comfortable mattress. Trundle bed was perfect for our kids and easy to use. Plenty of lighting. Decor was thoughtful, classy and (again) immaculate! Being right next to the airport, it came as no surprise that we heard a couple airplanes overhead.  (Kids slept right through them.)\\n\\nBathroom was immaculately clean with fresh towels and a new sink/vanity.\\n\\nWe didn't use the galley kitchen much but it appeared to be newly renovated with attractive tile and a modern design.\\n\\nWe very much enjoyed our dinner in the neighborhood which was at a Peruvian restaurant, Rincon Limeno. We highly recommend it!!\\n\\nOverall a perfect place for us to stay overnight with our two kids the night before our 6am flight out of Logan.\\n\\nThank you Susie and Mike!!!\"),\n",

I had pre-arranged to drop off my luggage very early Sunday morning after a red-eye flight but still felt bad ringing the door bell at 7:00am.  Sarah answered the door with a huge smile, led me upstairs, offered to let me take a shower before I headed out to have breakfast and explore and gave me a nice chilled bottle of water with keys to the main door.  \\n\\nShe communicated with me on when the room was ready and was there to greet me again and give me the room key.  She had already turned on the room A/C as it was very warm that day and the rest of the apartment didn't seem to be air conditioned.    Every time I saw her she was cheerful, warm and welcoming but really wasn't around much.  \\n\\nThe  location is just a couple blocks from the T in Eastie, one stop from the airport and 2 stops to State St.  There is road construction going on along the block that starts very early but certainly isn't Hector or Sarah's fault.  I didn't walk the area at night, choosing instead to use uber back from Fenway Park but it is a very quiet emerging neighborhood.  This is the perfect spot for a quick trip if you want to be close to the airport.  I was even able to leave my bag at the apartment until it was time to leave for my flight home thanks to Sarah's generosity.\\n\\nCommunication from the beginning was super fast and answered all my questions.

The place is very clean. Blow dryer was also provided for ladies and I think that's very considerate of Alex. I travelled with my husband and we had a great night of sleep on the memory form mattress but might be a bit snuggly for couples of bigger body frames. Another tenant was in the apt during our stay but he was quite and the curtain provided sufficient privacy.  Parking can be difficult around the area but Alex gave great advice. We ended up parking at the 1 center plaza for $24 for the weekends ($12/ day from 4p-4a). Overall, can't beat the price for what it offers.   I will recommend it. \"),\n",

The only thing that I had a hard time with (which isn't Tj's fault, it's boston's!) Was the street parking. For some reason Boston doesn't like outsiders parking on the streets but we were able to find a spot a short walk away but keep this in mind. I would definitely recommend staying at the apartment.

Switching from a database model to another is extremely painful in big companies. Secondly, because relational database still offers a very convenient solution for storing structured data, based on a relational model. <br/>\n",

Emergence of World Wide Web websites using big data volume and real-time web applications triggered the needs to increase speed of computation. One of the main limitation of relational databases is their inability to distribute computation. Relational database are constructed on the idea that each transaction is done sequentially. <br/>\n",
